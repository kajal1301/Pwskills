        "5. Reproducibility and version control: A well-designed data pipeline promotes reproducibility by maintaining a version-controlled pipeline configuration, data transformations, and processing steps. It allows for easy replication of experiments, model training, and evaluation, ensuring consistency and enabling collaboration among team members. Reproducibility is crucial for transparent research, debugging, or troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Data integration and enrichment: A data pipeline facilitates the integration of diverse data sources, such as databases, APIs, or streaming platforms, into a unified and consistent format. It enables data enrichment by combining multiple data streams, external data sources, or derived features to enhance the quality and richness of the data used for machine learning.\n",
