RNNs, such as LSTM or GRU, can model sequential dependencies in text data, allowing for contextual understanding. CNNs leverage local patterns and capture n-gram features in text data. These models can learn from large-scale text corpora and achieve state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation."

Applications of multi-modal CNNs include image captioning, visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, or sentiment analysis from text and image data. Multi-modal fusion techniques include early fusion, late fusion, or attention-based fusion. Multi-modal CNNs facilitate richer representations, better integration of heterogeneous data, and enhanced  performance in tasks where multiple modalities provide complementary information."

Techniques for addressing class imbalance include oversampling minority classes through methods like SMOTE or ADASYN, undersampling majority classes, or using hybrid approaches. Cost-sensitive learning assigns different misclassification costs to different classes. Focal loss or weighted loss functions assign higher weights to minority classes. Another approach is to modify the decision threshold during prediction to achieve a balance between precision and recall for different classes. Addressing class imbalance improves model performance and ensures fair representation of all classes in CNN classification tasks."

Transfer learning can be achieved by freezing certain layers and fine-tuning the remaining layers on the new task-specific data. It allows for better generalization and faster convergence by leveraging the learned features and representations from the pre-trained model. Transfer learning is particularly useful in domains with limited data availability or when training from scratch is impractical."
